Dual Licensing
--------------

Relfinder (including either relfinder-api - http://github.com/nwa-catch-me-if-you-can-project/relfinder-api or relfinder-frontend - http://github.com/nwa-catch-me-if-you-can-project/relfinder-frontend) is available under a dual licensing [1] scheme whereby use of Relfinder in projects that are licensed so as to be compatible with AGPL Version 3 may use Relfinder under the terms of the compatible license. Please see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt for more details.                   

However, if AGPL Version 3.0 terms are incompatible with your use of Relfinder, please direct inquiries about alternative license terms to Kody Moodley (kody.moodley@gmail.com) and Walter Simoncini (walter@ashita.nl). 

Why Dual Licensing?
-------------------

Dual licensing has two advantages for this project:

1. it lets us focus on building and improving on Relfinder 
2. it lowers the barriers of evaluation and adoption for organizations who
want to try RDF, Knowledge Graph and Semantic Web technologies

Which License Should I Choose?
------------------------------

* If your software is licensed under a recognized open source license [2], you can use Relfinder under its open source license terms (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt) without further consideration.

* However, if your software is not licensed under an open source compatible license, such as a proprietary license, then you should contact the developers: Kody Moodley (kody.moodley@gmail.com) and Walter Simoncini (walter@ashita.nl) in order to arrange alternative license terms to cover your use of Relfinder.

In short,

* If you derive a commercial advantage by using Relfinder with a closed source solution, or even you if you (re)use Relfinder source code with a non-commercial closed source solution, you must arrange alternative license terms for your use of Relfinder which will, at a minimum, remove the need to publish your source code. Contact the developers for details about this.

* If you wish to use Relfinder under its open source terms, you must include due credit and attribution to the developers of Relfinder in your source code and documentation for your solution. And, you must contribute back to the community the source code for the solution you use Relfinder with, so that others may benefit from it as you benefit from Relfinder.
